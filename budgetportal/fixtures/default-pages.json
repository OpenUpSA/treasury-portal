The three-year \\\\nfuture budget refers to the next three years and is known as the \\\\nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).\\\\n  </p>\\\\n\\\\n  <p>\\\\n    For example, the 2018 ENE documents include the audited budget \\\\noutcomes for the 2014/15, 2015/16, and 2016/17 financial years, the \\\\nrevised estimates for the 2017/18 financial year, and initial estimates \\\\nfor the 2018/19, 2019/20, and 2020/21 financial years.\\\\n  </p>\\\\n\\\\n  <p>\\\\n    <strong>Expenditure by economic classification</strong>: This refers\\\\n to the economic characteristics of the expenditure, including whether \\\\nthe expenditure happens directly in a national department, transferred \\\\nto another sphere of government or to another party.\\\\n  </p>\\\\n\\\\n  <p>\\\\n    There are up to four levels of economic classification for each \\\\nexpenditure item (i.e. Levels 1 to 4), with higher levels representing \\\\ngreater degrees of granularity. The Excel and CSV documents include all \\\\nfour levels while the PDF documents display the first two levels.\\\\n  </p>\\\\n\\\\n  <p>\\\\n    The level 1 economic classification divides all expenditure into \\\\nfour main economic sections: current payments (payments made for \\\\noperational requirements such as those for compensation of employees and\\\\n goods and services); transfers and subsidies; payments for capital \\\\nassets (assets that can be used for more than one year); and payments \\\\nfor financial assets (loans or equity investments in public \\\\ncorporations).\\\\n  </p>\\\\n\\\\n  <p>\\\\n    <strong>Expenditure by programme and sub-programme</strong>: This \\\\nrefers to expenditure by department programmes, which align spending to \\\\nactivities, performance indicators and outcomes. Each programme has a \\\\nparticular purpose and spending objectives. Spending can be tracked to \\\\nthe programme and sub-programme level.\\\\n  </p>\\\\n\\\\n  <p>\\\\n    <strong>Expenditure by government function</strong>: This aligns \\\\nexpenditure to one of seven government function groups. These groups can\\\\n include spending across many government institutions, departments, and \\\\nspheres. The function groups are also allocated to sections of the \\\\nNational Development Plan and medium-term strategic framework (MTSF) \\\\noutcomes.\\\\n  </p>\\\\n\\\\n  <p>\\\\n    For example, expenditure on Basic Education falls within the \\\\nLearning and Culture function group, Chapters 3 and 9 of the NDP, and \\\\nOutcome 5 of the MTSF. The Learning and Culture function group includes \\\\nthe Departments of Higher Education and Training, Sport and Recreation, \\\\nand Art and Culture.

For example, one performance indicator in the Education\\\\n Enrichment Services programme is the number of schools provided with \\\\nnutritious meals each school day.

There are 47 departments in the 2018 ENE.\\\\n    </li><li>\\\\n      <strong>Economic Classification Levels 1 to 4</strong>: These four\\\\n fields refer to the economic classification of the expenditure, with \\\\nhigher levels indicating a greater degree of disaggregation and \\\\ngranularity. The four main economic sections (Level 1) are current \\\\nspending, transfers and subsidies, payments for financial assets, and \\\\npayments for capital assets.\\\\n    </li><li>\\\\n      <strong>Financial Year</strong>: This refers to the national / \\\\nprovincial financial year which begins on April 1 and ends on March 31 \\\\nof the following calendar year. For example, the 2014 financial year \\\\nbegan on 1 April 2014 and ended on 31 March 2015.
